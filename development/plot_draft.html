<b>Original backstory</b><br>
﻿When the Persian king died, his firstborn son Artaxerxes took over his empire while the younger son Cyrus was made governor of it's largest province. Desiring the throne, Cyrus trained his Persian troops and bought the friendship of several Greek rulers. When the opportunity presented itself, he called for his allies under the pretext of a quarrel with another governor.<br>

Anabasis is the story about the fate of these 10000 Greek mercenaries, written by the historian Xenophon who accompanied them.<br><br><br>


<b>Wesnothian backstory</b><br>
Prince Eldred desired the throne of his father. Killing Garard wouldn't be the problem, but how would the Wesnothian army react to the betrayal of their king? He would need experienced soldiers on his side, and only a small part of the troops were loyal to him. Thus he hired the khalifate troops under the pretense of fighting necromancers. In 501 YW at the ford of Abez, he seized the opportunity to backstab his father while the battle raged on, knowing that he soon would have his reinforcements. Delfador gathered an army primarily out of volunteers to avenge Garard's betrayal, which the heavy khalifate infantry crush at Weldyn. But there's a catch - Eldred gets killed in the battle. Asheviere seizes power, and she has no further use for the mercenaries and turns her back on them. They want compensation for their services, but she refuses.

<b>Introduction</b><br>
When fort Than was built and we reestablished contacts with the people of Wesnoth, we were eager to hear of our brethren. While we grudgingly acknowledged that they still practiced magic, at least we found common ground in the ban of the most disgusting of the forbidden arts, necromancy.<br><br>

Thus, when Prince Eldred called for our help against a horde of undead invading his kingdom, we gathered 10,000 / a thousand men and marched for Wesnoth. After all, Eldred was a friend of the Khalifate who had given us trading privileges and a considerable amount of gold during the last years. Our army split into three detachments travelling separately along the desert roads from oasis to oasis in order to prevent attrition.<br><br>

But when we met the Wesnothians, they had bitter news: King Garard had been slain in a battle against the orcs, and his mage-counsellor Delfador seized the opportunity: He had fielded am army against Eldred and taken his capital, Weldyn.<br>
As much as we disliked the thought of killing fellow humans, we couldn't let Wesnoth fall to one of these corrupted mages!<br>

<br><br><br>


<b>1. Scenario: Phyrrian victory</b><br>
<i>directly north of Weldyn, grassland with a few suburbs, city wall at the map's edge</i><br>

Two abilities define the intended play-style:
<ul>
  <li>phalanx: A defensive line (being in the middle of two neighbouring allies) is awarded by +10 resistance</li>
  <li>All attacks on fleeing enemies count as backstabbing</li>
</ul>

As the huge enemy army sees how little damage it does to your battle formation, most of them begin to flee and the player sweeps up the remaining resistance. The scenario ends as soon as you climb the city wall.
<br><br>
But wait -  wasn't I promising you an epic story?<br>
Eldred and his guard of knights follow the good old rule of dashing forward and getting their leader killed - Delfador deals the killing blow. You have won the battle, but lost the war.
<br><br><br>


<b>2. cutscene: Hospitality</b><br>
<i>On the streets of Weldyn (houses are impassable, housing blocks separated by roads of several tiles width)</i><br>
The khalifate soldiers chase the fleeing defenders out of town. The enemies leave the map, a messenger arrives and tells them of Eldreds death by the hands of Delfador.<br><br>


<br><br>
Plundered our provision train without which there was no heading back through the desert!
<br>
Their generals leave to meet with Asheviere to negotiate for a safe passage back and whatever help they can get. But she has no further use for the troops that secured her throne - a courier brings back the heads of the khalifate generals, 
<!--- accusing them of having plotted against her and demanding surrender of the army. --->
<br>

Xenophon persuades his comrades not to despair but to do an ordered retreat. They elect a new group of leaders including Xenophon who from now on is the main character.
<br><br><br>


<b>3. Scenario: On the march</b><br>
<i>Objective:  Cross the map</i><br>
In order to get the formation bonus from all sides, the khalifate army forms a square (for Wesnoth it'll be a hexagon I guess) with the weaker troops in the middle (dwarven allies as they are quite vulnerable in the plains?). You, Xenophon, are in command of the rearguard while the other flanks continuously move forward.<br>
Alas, the pursuers do swift ranged attacks and retreat before the heavier khalifate fighters can retaliate. They have a battalion of cavalry ready, so it's risky to break formation. For the player, it should be a difficult balance whether to pursue them or stay in formation with the AI ally.<br><br>

<i>After the scenario, you'll get ranged units and a few horsemen on your recruit list (historically: stone slings & 50 horses mostly from the baggage train).</i>
<br><br><br>


<b>4. (optional, possibly later) cutscene</b><br>
The army crosses the river Tigris, then marvels at the massive defences (3 tiles thick walls) of Larissa/Halstead - a prosperous Persian city on the river bank. Good opportunity to present some khalifate lore.<br><br>


For the coming scenarios, the overall terrain theme changes from sand and plains to hills and mountain passes. Story screen explaining that a forced march during the night gives us a head start to the Persian detachment, we travel unhindered for several days.
<br><br><br>


<b>5. Pressing through</b><br>
Unfortunately, the Persians imitate the Greek maneuver: "the babarians had pushed on by a forced night march and occupied a commanding position on the right, where the Hellenes had to pass. It was a narrow mountain spur overhanging the descent into the plain."<br>
The road forward its blocked while the main body of the Persian army slowly closes up from behind (They'll appear after 15 turns).<br>
The detachment on the crest forgot one detail tough - if the Greeks were to occupy the mountain behind them, they could charge down from it and annihilate them.<br>
Cheirisophus, a general superior to Xenophon,  calls him from his position at the rear. They discuss the situation on both sides and decide to make a run for it.  Cheirisophus gives you the choice: Do you want to race up the mountain path or stay behind, delaying the pursuers?<br>
<i>Whoever goes up receives light infantry + 3 fast heavier soldiers.</i><br><br>

After turn 2, the enemies ahead will notice the group hurrying for the summit and send troops there as well. It is a tense race for the high ground.<br>
If you hold the summit for two turns, the Persians will retire from their position in order not to be flanked from above. The main army can pass through and (the map grows... like e.g. in LoW Human Alliance) reaches the plain behind the hills. There, they find plenty of villages.<br>

In the meantime, half of the Persian army left the map on the side to take a different route. After you got hold of enough of these villages, these troops will appear and start to burn the villages to deprive the Greeks of provisions (yes, that really happened).<br>
Xenophon remarks how reckless or desperate the Persians must be to burn their countrymen's homes, and proposes to prevent it, but Cheirisophus considers it more important to press on.

<b>optional: 7. Thanks, but no thanks...</b><br>
We might decide to accompany the dwarves home first as it's nearly on the way, and to have a guide?<br>
Nice little cultural shock - living underground?<br>
Dwarves invite them to pass trough their caverns and see their local capital, the guests-to-be kindly refuse (later option for a branch point if we see fit).<br><br>

<i>map: entrance to the cave system - the inside is magnificent, plastered floor, torches all along the walls, ...</i><br><br>

"Why are these caverns so tall, if I may ask? The ceiling must be two men high!"<br>
<i>(smiling)</i>"Impressed? You'll have to wait until we're in the throne room, there's plenty to be astounded of. We dwarves like it spacious - all but some strategically relevant passages are as high as this. You see, what we don't have in size we make up in grandeur."<br>
"See the throne room? You don't suggest us to pass <i>under</i> these mountains?"<br>
"Sure. No trolls, no undead, no chasing army - what more could you want?"<br>
"It... it isn't... excuse me, but without the blazing sun that accompanied us all our lives, ... We just don't dare to go underground."<br>
"Have it your way, no offence taken. You have the pick then - trolls in the hills ahead or march back to the valley of death?"<br>
"What exactly are trolls, if I may ask?"<br>
"Oh, you can't miss them. I don't want to spoil your fun. I can tell you though that the valley is infested with undead, which your blades are rather useless against."<br>
"We came here because Eldred mislead us to believe there are necromancers to crush. Rest assured we have our ways to deal with these."<br>
A naffat: "If I may demonstrate..."<br>
<i>flames spouting out (animated halo could be mainlined)</i><br>
"Ho, nice invention, lads. Not too far from our own designs. In fact, have you considered ..."<br>
<i>screen blacks out and back in</i><br>
Narrator: Thanks to the technological exchange, your Qatif now can advance to Tineen!<br>
<i>optional: Show an enthusiastic dwarf with a flametrower? There's already a L2 unit in UMC</i><br>
"Now, do we go back for these abominations?"<br><br>
choice:
<ul>
  <li>"After what the Wesnothians did to us, let them deal with it themselves."</li>
  <li>"Let us wipe them off the face of the earth!"</li>
</ul>

The dwarves will love you if you choose the latter ("That's the spirit!")

<b>8. Living rock</b><br>
<i>story text:</i><br>
... and sometimes we have to dismiss our moral standards for the common good - killing innocents for our own survival.<br><br>

<b>Xenophon</b>: The road ahead is blocked, and these creatures of stone at the top don't seem friendly... but we have to hurry, if the army attacks us here we're caged!<br>

<b>Cheirisophus</b>: Calm down, there might be a way to bypass them. During the skirmish yesterday my men caught two prisoners, perhaps we can get them to talk...<br>
<i> prisoners appear, Cheirisophus repeatedly hits one of them with 1 damage </i><br>
<b>prisoner 1</b>: I told you, there it only the path ahead!<br>
<i> Cheirisophus kills him, turns towards the second prisoner </i><br>
<b>Cheirisophus</b>: Now, do <b>you</b> have something to tell us?<br>
<b>prisoner 2</b>: I don't want to die! I beg you, let me live and I will show you a secret path to their position.<br>
<i> shroud lifts around the entrance </i><br>
<b>Cheirisophus</b>: Well, well. Xenophon, take a party of our light infantry up that path and see whether we can't dislodge them from their position. In the meantime, I'll feint attacks via the road to get their attention.
<br><br>


The trolls roll down large boulders to prevent the player from advancing. A boulder will randomly move to one of the two hexes in front of it each turn, inflicting 30-60 damage. If a boulder hits the rocks (mountain terrain) left and right of the road, it will bounce off
<!--- , releasing a shower of splinters doing 10 damage to everyone in range --->.
<br><br>

optional: The khalifa never saw trolls, so if a troll doesn't move, it blends in with his surroundings if standing on mountain terrain (ambush ability). Thank god they aren't aware of it... (our excuse that the AI doesn't need to consider it)
<br><br>

There is one unexpected hurdle - of course the trolls won't leave their flank unprotected. You'll encounter 2-3 troll whelps near the end of the path that run back and alert the other trolls. Thus, you have to rush in quickly before they can block the passage (<i>and they'd do that efficiently... mattsc's bottleneck AI will assure that</i>).
