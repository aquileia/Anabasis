<b>Introduction</b><br>
﻿When the Persian king died, his firstborn son Artaxerxes took over his empire while the younger son Cyrus was made governor of it's largest province. Desiring the throne, Cyrus trained his Persian troops and bought the friendship of several Greek rulers. When the opportunity presented itself, he called for his allies under the pretext of a quarrel with another governor.<br>

Anabasis is the story about the fate of these 10000 Greek mercenaries, written by the historian Xenophon who accompanied them.<br><br><br>


<b>1. Scenario: Phyrrian victory</b><br>
<i>day-night cycle of 1 turn per hour, time from dawn to dusk</i><br>
The first scenarios are in the plains. While the land is more fertile around the rivers, most parts are dry and sandy.<br>
We begin with what seems to be the climax... the battle between the armies of Cyrus and Artaxerxes. As the huge enemy army sees how little damage it does to the Greek phalanx (remember the defence bonus? ) most of them begin to flee and the player sweeps up the remaining resistance.  To make that easier, every attack on a fleeing enemy counts as backstabbing.<br><br>
But wait -  wasn't I promising you an epic story?<br>
Your ally Cyrus and his guard of elite horsemen follow the good old rule of dashing forward and getting their leader killed! You have won the battle, but lost the war.<br><br><br>


<b>2. cutscene: Persian hospitality</b><br>
<i>Place: Inside the Greek camp</i><br>
The Greek mercenaries are still the strongest force in Persia. They don't want to leave empty-handed, but without Cyrus their expedition it's over. Their generals leave to meet with a representative to negotiate for a safe passage back and whatever gold they can get.<br>
The meeting was a trap devised by Artaxerxes - a courier brings back the heads of the Greek generals, accusing them of having plotted against the king  and demands surrender. Xenophon persuades his comrades not to despair but to do an ordered retreat. They elect a new group of leaders including Xenophon who from now on is the main character.<br><br><br>


<b>3. Scenario: On the march</b><br>
<i>Objective:  Cross the map</i><br>
In order to get the formation bonus from all sides, the Greek army forms a square (for Wesnoth it'll be a hexagon I guess) with the weaker, ranged troops in the middle. You, Xenophon, are in command of the rearguard.<br>
Alas, the pursuers do swift ranged attacks and retreat before the heavier Greek fighters can retaliate. They have a battalion of cavalry ready, so it's risky to break formation. For the player, it should be a difficult balance whether to pursue them or stay in formation with the AI ally.<br><br>

<i>After the scenario, you'll get ranged units and a few horsemen on your recruit list (historically: stone slings & 50 horses mostly from the baggage train).</i><br><br><br>


<b>4. (optional) cutscene</b><br>
The army crosses the river Tigris, then marvels at the massive defences (3 tiles thick walls) of Larissa - a prosperous Persian city on the river bank. Good opportunity to present some khalifate lore.<br><br>


For the coming scenarios, the overall terrain theme changes from sand and plains to hills and mountain passes. Story screen explaining that a forced march during the night gives us a head start to the Persian detachment, we travel unhindered for several days.<br><br><br>


<b>5. Pressing through</b><br>
Unfortunately, the Persians imitate the Greek maneuver: "the babarians had pushed on by a forced night march and occupied a commanding position on the right, where the Hellenes had to pass. It was a narrow mountain spur overhanging the descent into the plain."<br>
The road forward its blocked while the main body of the Persian army slowly closes up from behind (They'll appear after 15 turns).<br>
The detachment on the crest forgot one detail tough - if the Greeks were to occupy the mountain behind them, they could charge down from it and annihilate them.<br>
Cheirisophus, a general superior to Xenophon,  calls him from his position at the rear. They discuss the situation on both sides and decide to make a run for it.  Cheirisophus gives you the choice: Do you want to race up the mountain path or stay behind, delaying the pursuers?<br>
<i>Whoever goes up receives light infantry + 3 fast heavier soldiers.</i><br><br>

After turn 2, the enemies ahead will notice the group hurrying for the summit and send troops there as well. It is a tense race for the high ground.<br>
If you hold the summit for two turns, the Persians will retire from their position in order not to be flanked from above. The main army can pass through and (the map grows... like e.g. in LoW Human Alliance) reaches the plain behind the hills. There, they find plenty of villages.<br>

In the meantime, half of the Persian army left the map on the side to take a different route. After you got hold of enough of these villages, these troops will appear and start to burn the villages to deprive the Greeks of provisions (yes, that really happened).<br>
Xenophon remarks how reckless or desperate the Persians must be to burn their countrymen's homes, and proposes to prevent it, but Cheirisophus considers it more important to press on.<br><br><br>
