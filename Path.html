<h1>Journey</h1>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
With their provisions plundered and the villages at the oases not yet restocked, the direct route back is impossible.<br><br>
Nobody would make a detour to pass through mountains, quite the opposite. But we need a mountain pass for "Living rock"<br>
The central plains only have two adjacent mountainous regions: The Dulatus hills and the Gryphon mountain.<br><br>


<h2>Track 1: South to the Sleepless Sea</h2>

Weldyn – just east of the Dulatus hills – through Dulatus hills – Fort Than – west towards the Aethenwood, but rejected – city on the coast of the inner sea – sea travel<br><br>


Advantages:
<ul>
  <li>Less restrictions as the area isn't shown in mainline</li>
</ul>

Main problems:
<ul>
  <li>Need a port (khalifate traders?) on area mapped by TSG</li>
  <li>There's only the mountains of peril between them and their destination, why wait for ships?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Track 2: North to Elensefar</h2>

Weldyn – Tath – dwarven caves north of gryphon mountain – hills north of gr. Mountain / valley of death – grey woods – Halstead – Elensefar – sea travel<br><br>


Advantages: 
<ul>
  <li>Cross references HttT: Huge falcons! Exciting! – valley of death</li>
  <li>Cross reference Liberty: impenetrable fortress Halstead</li>
  <li>Elensefar can muster a sufficient fleet</li>
</ul>

Main problems:
<ul>
  <li>In case we choose the valley of death, why is Konrad still batling off the undead there in HttT? Didn't we get their mastermind?</li>
  <li>Can we have trolls and dwarves in the hills south of gryphon mountain?</li>
</ul>

This shall not be the end: Battles await you back home!
